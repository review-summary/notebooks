If you must buy these levis get them at least 2-3 sizes larger in the waist and 2 sizes longer than you normally wear.

It arrived on time which is the only thing I have good to say about the purchasing experience. The tag on the jeans says 36/32 but I measured it and it is 32/32, which is a relief since it no where near fit me. The other huge disappointment is the material this pair of jeans were made of. Like I said before, I've been wearing 501s for years and I've never had a pair that the denim was so thin, I mean paper thin.

There is no reason why a made in U.S. jean by an American brand should cost $200 a pair.

Recently though, the sizes have been all over the place.  I'm also very disappointed in the quality.  I can't get a pair to last more than 6 months without wearing out the knees or the crotch.  Definitely cheaper materials being used and I can just tell by the feel that they are much thinner than they use to be.  I needed a new pair of jeans a couple weeks ago (since my Levi's gave out after only a couple months) and decided to try a different brand.  After looking at several of them I decided to give Wranglers a try.  Mainly because they are made out of a thicker denim plus they only cost a third of what my Levi's did.  I've worn them for about a month pretty much on a daily basis and they look as good as when I bought them.  If I can get them to last twice as long for a third of the cost I'm going to save myself a lot of money.  While I miss the button fly I think I can easily get use to these jeans.  Sorry Levi's but you lost this loyal customer by making inferior product and charging too much for it!\n",

I finally took the time with these last 2 pair I've ordered & measured seam to seam on the front of each leg. From the crotch, 16 in. down, the left leg was 8.25 in across & the right leg was 8.0 in across - so there's the prob. - since the fit seems the same, the back of the leg fabric must be cut to larger to make up for the shortage on the front.

I am a larger person, but the jeans were loose fitting on me which was fine as I usually order a size or two up to allow for shrinkage.  The first washing they went from Black to a streaked washed denim look, I was ok with that, but should have suspected something wasn't quite right.  After only 3 washes and on the 4th wearing the denim let go in the groin when I was sitting down.  Something that hasn't happened in other pants I've owned util I've worn them for 4-5 years of hard use.  I was not pleased at all and won't be buying the black 501's again anytime soon.

I wish Levi's would stop making all of their baggy pants, and pants with frills and pocket covers,factory rips, and a bunch of different spandex added to jeans that fall apart quickly. They should limit their collection, keep it simple, and make fewer things, but better things. I don't want a hundred cheaply made choices, just a few good durable ones.

Now I have a desk job, and they wear out in less than a year.  The denim of two pairs has worn thin around the pockets and thighs, while the pocket liners have remained in tact.  That seems to say something about the relative quality of the materials.  I thought denim was supposed to be tough?

So, when internet shopping came into vogue, things were even easier.  Until a couple of years ago.  Starting then, my good old size started showing up too big, or too small, or wouldn't shrink right.  Bottom line is that I wound up with several unusable pairs of jeans.  So, I finally bit the bullet and made the trek to Macy's.  Tried on 4-5 pairs of identically marked jeans and they were all over the map.  Found a pair that fit.  Washed them once and they turned into floods.  Returned them and got another pair.  Washed them and they're ok.  So, I'm done with buying jeans online.  And I'm probably done with Levi's.\n",
      "\n",
      "I say \"probably\" because this assumes I can find anything any better.  The market provides what the consumer demands, and apparently what the American consumer demands is cheap, useless junk.  As other reviewers have observed, the current version of Levi's denim is shameful.  Not only is it thin and non-wearing,  but since it shrinks along one bias more than the other, it is important to orient the fabric in the machine correctly.  Apparently, this is too much to ask.  Ditto for getting either the waist or the leg to match the label.\n",

      "I have been buying the sized 501's (not the Shrink-to=Fits) for my husband for nearly 15 years.  Starting almost a year ago it is an absolute fact that these jeans no longer hold up for years the way they used to.  In the past (at least up until 2 or 3 years ago) my husband would have about 4 pairs of jeans, so he might be washing them farily frequently.  It was not unusual for a pair to last at least a couple of years.  But since a year and a half ago or so, his jeans have been wearing through in about 4 to 6 months.  He has many more pairs, so they do not get washed as often and are not subject to stress from the washer and dryer.  The seams split at the crotch and down the legs and the seat wears.  He does not give them rough wear.  He is a college professor who is on his feet a lot, but not in a physically stressful job.  Levi's just are not as good as they used to be and any one who says differently hasn't been buying them or wearing them as much as we have.\n",

Living out in the country it is too difficult and costs too much to send the items back in to Amazon. The 501's I have were made in Egypt, Mexico, Haiti and other various places. The labels all match in size however some of the jeans are at least a full size smaller at the waist and some of the pairs have the correct waist but very narrow legs.

If you must buy these levis get them at least 2-3 sizes larger in the waist and 2 sizes longer than you normally wear.

It arrived on time which is the only thing I have good to say about the purchasing experience. The tag on the jeans says 36/32 but I measured it and it is 32/32, which is a relief since it no where near fit me. The other huge disappointment is the material this pair of jeans were made of. Like I said before, I've been wearing 501s for years and I've never had a pair that the denim was so thin, I mean paper thin.

It's a wasteful process and such a shame. I was hoping I could dodge all the low quality crap and go with a tried and true brand such as Levi's, but they seem to be no different from the rest.  There is no reason why a made in U.S. jean by an American brand should cost $200 a pair.

I use to be able to walk into the store, grab my size off the shelf and pay for them.  I would have sales people ask if I wanted to try them on and I would say \"no thanks, I know they fit\".  Recently though, the sizes have been all over the place.  I'm also very disappointed in the quality.  I can't get a pair to last more than 6 months without wearing out the knees or the crotch.  Definitely cheaper materials being used and I can just tell by the feel that they are much thinner than they use to be.  I needed a new pair of jeans a couple weeks ago (since my Levi's gave out after only a couple months) and decided to try a different brand.  After looking at several of them I decided to give Wranglers a try.  Mainly because they are made out of a thicker denim plus they only cost a third of what my Levi's did.  I've worn them for about a month pretty much on a daily basis and they look as good as when I bought them.  If I can get them to last twice as long for a third of the cost I'm going to save myself a lot of money.  While I miss the button fly I think I can easily get use to these jeans.

They are uncomfortable and my shirt won't stay tucked in. They also have two less belt loops. My favorite, \"wear them every day pants\" have gone to hell!\n",

The seam on the right leg, starting right above the knee, is towards the front of the jeans (& gets progressively worse to the hem), not down the side. I finally took the time with these last 2 pair I've ordered & measured seam to seam on the front of each leg. From the crotch, 16 in. down, the left leg was 8.25 in across & the right leg was 8.0 in across - so there's the prob. - since the fit seems the same, the back of the leg fabric must be cut to larger to make up for the shortage on the front. Levi's needs some serious help with quality control. These last few pair are made in Egypt. Looks like I'll have to give up & find a diff. brand of jeans.

The first washing they went from Black to a streaked washed denim look, I was ok with that, but should have suspected something wasn't quite right.  After only 3 washes and on the 4th wearing the denim let go in the groin when I was sitting down.  Something that hasn't happened in other pants I've owned util I've worn them for 4-5 years of hard use.  I was not pleased at all and won't be buying the black 501's again anytime soon.  I have other regular Levi's that seem to hold up just fine, but reading some of the reviews apparently I'm not the only guy who felt a breeze where they weren't expecting it, in a very short time after wearing these jeans...\n",

      "These are not the original Levi 501s.  I wore 501s for many years until they started to charge designer jean prices.  I always liked the fit feel and durability but went to buying $15 jeans at wal-mart years ago.  A couple weeks ago at a weak moment I ordered a pair of these from Amazon.  For over $40 I expected to get the same quality jeans I remembered.  The denim while quite heavy is not the same,  The buttons are not the same.  The inside seams on the legs are not the same.  These are not major faults and they have the old Levi's fit but at the price I expected the genuine article.\n",

It just has a little trademark symbol and a blank red tag. This is not what i was looking for. I wish Levi's would stop making all of their baggy pants, and pants with frills and pocket covers,factory rips, and a bunch of different spandex added to jeans that fall apart quickly. They should limit their collection, keep it simple, and make fewer things, but better things. I don't want a hundred cheaply made choices, just a few good durable ones. Drop the frivolous designs, keep the classics, add a skinny and a baggy fit option. done.  Better yet, drop the skinny and let people sew their own stove-pipe legs..drop the baggy options completely, and let some other company specialize in those clown pants.\n",

They used to take ages to make a pair look worn-out (which I thought was cool back then), and that was while I was climbing trees, skateboarding, what-have-you.  Times have changed.  Now I have a desk job, and they wear out in less than a year.  The denim of two pairs has worn thin around the pockets and thighs, while the pocket liners have remained in tact.  That seems to say something about the relative quality of the materials.  I thought denim was supposed to be tough?  And unlike some of the people commenting about the risks of buying mail order, I'm talking about jeans I bought from a shop.

      "I hate to shop and normally just ask my wife to pick up some jeans when she's at the store.  I know my size, and this has always worked.  So, when internet shopping came into vogue, things were even easier.  Until a couple of years ago.  Starting then, my good old size started showing up too big, or too small, or wouldn't shrink right.  Bottom line is that I wound up with several unusable pairs of jeans.  So, I finally bit the bullet and made the trek to Macy's.  Tried on 4-5 pairs of identically marked jeans and they were all over the map.  Found a pair that fit.  Washed them once and they turned into floods.  Returned them and got another pair.  Washed them and they're ok.  So, I'm done with buying jeans online.  And I'm probably done with Levi's.\n",
      "\n",
      "I say \"probably\" because this assumes I can find anything any better.  The market provides what the consumer demands, and apparently what the American consumer demands is cheap, useless junk.  As other reviewers have observed, the current version of Levi's denim is shameful.  Not only is it thin and non-wearing,  but since it shrinks along one bias more than the other, it is important to orient the fabric in the machine correctly.  Apparently, this is too much to ask.  Ditto for getting either the waist or the leg to match the label.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line:  My advice is, if you're going to buy Levi's, don't do it online.  It just doesn't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been buying the sized 501's (not the Shrink-to=Fits) for my husband for nearly 15 years.  Starting almost a year ago it is an absolute fact that these jeans no longer hold up for years the way they used to.  In the past (at least up until 2 or 3 years ago) my husband would have about 4 pairs of jeans, so he might be washing them farily frequently.  It was not unusual for a pair to last at least a couple of years.  But since a year and a half ago or so, his jeans have been wearing through in about 4 to 6 months.  He has many more pairs, so they do not get washed as often and are not subject to stress from the washer and dryer.  The seams split at the crotch and down the legs and the seat wears.  He does not give them rough wear.  He is a college professor who is on his feet a lot, but not in a physically stressful job.  Levi's just are not as good as they used to be and any one who says differently hasn't been buying them or wearing them as much as we have.\n",

Living out in the country it is too difficult and costs too much to send the items back in to Amazon. The 501's I have were made in Egypt, Mexico, Haiti and other various places. The labels all match in size however some of the jeans are at least a full size smaller at the waist and some of the pairs have the correct waist but very narrow legs.

Unfortunately, the consistency of quality is nothing compared to what it used to be. I have ordered 3 pair over a period of time (6months), all 501. Different colors. Same size. Each pair is different. Different material, different sizing, different construction. The denim on all three are totally different. One pair is so thin you can almost see through them. Another pair has thick denim as stiff as a board, yet another pair is exactly as it should be. The leg openings are different on each pair as much as an inch smaller to an inch bigger. The stitching and workmanship is mediocre at best. I'm very disappointed. The 501 is the original Levi Jean, why would you stray from anything that has worked so well for so long. These jeans do not qualify for the price point they are currently being offered at. Maybe half, if I was feeling generous. So, after close to 20 years of being a loyal, die hard Levi 501 consumer, NO MORE!!! I WILL NOT PAY QUALITY PRICE FOR SUB PAR PRODUCT. SHAME ON YOU LEVI!!!

Two more pairs of 501s from Macy's, same thing. Levi's really has to step their game up, or they are going to lose the American market. The sad thing is that the same Chinese and Egyptian-made 501s are going for the equivalent of about US$100 in department stores in Taiwan.

The only thing consistent about the 501's (and the 514's) is that the inconsistency in both fit, size, and especially quality is astounding. I called Levi's myself, and they are aware of the inconsistentency in their products. They have opened up new factories so quickly, that the problem went unnoticed for almost 2 years. They were very honest with me, and are working diligently to alleviate the problem. Eighteen pair of mine are perfect in every way. All are consistent in every way. The last two pair I purchased were off to each other in every way. The waist and inseam are off as much as 3/4 of an inch. When I put my wallet in the back pocket on one new pair, The back pocket ripped @ the corner. That when I called them, and they admitted that the weight of the denim was one of the problems.

Mexico always makes the pants that fit perfectly for whatever size needed. I gained weight and needed 35\" waisted pants, something impossible to find in stores, so I ended up buying them from The Levi's Store online - and never had a problem with the sizing. I've now lost some weight and need 33\" waisted pants. Just bought 2 pair from Amazon (they were about the same cost but 2 day free shipping on Amazon). The other pair was 33\"x32\" 501s called \"Bleached\" - tried them on - and PERFECT. Checked the tag and yup - made in Mexico. (On a side note, Amazon's website shows that ALL their 501s are made in Mexico which is a total lie). When I tried this pair on, they were TIGHT! Aside from barely able to getting them up, the button-up fly eyes weren't the normal size - I could barely get the button through the buttonhole on every single button. Got them all buttoned up and - ack - I could barely breath! Had just as much problem getting the button fly OPEN as I did closing it - then it took an extra hand to peel the pant leg off. I checked the tag and - made in Mexica? HAHAHA, no, no, no. They were made in Egypt! Any pants I've receive made in Egypt, Burma, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia - anywhere but Mexico - they are too small! These are going back - but at least the other pair fit (love the color of the Bleached!) and guess I'm back to ordering through Levi's or in an actual store.\n",

They had all these different colors in the cheapest feeling materials imaginable. The black ones felt and looked like they were dipped in wax. I wouldn't even consider all the pretty reds and greens and blues. Levi's were always made for men. Now it seems they are mad for 'funny' men. Even the blue jean material felt thin and cheap. I wouldn't even try them on and left the store. I went to Kohl's and tried on a pair of Lee's. What a difference! They are made of real denim, fit well and were cheaper.

The pair I purchased with Amazon I noticed were manufactured in Mexico and had a different tag than my normal jeans.

There was also an issue with the room around the buttons on the fly, they did not give sufficient room to manipulate them. I threw them in the trash, a $100 loss. I have been wearing Levis for 50 years and never have seen such poor quality.\n",

I have no assurance that these will last longer than that either.\n",

The styling on Levi's are bizarre because I have a pair of slim fit Levi's that are a smaller size than these (32x32) and they fit more loose than the 501's. I've owned higher end jeans by Armani Exchange, some slim fit by the Swedish company Cheap Monday. And the fit on these are tighter on my thighs than either of those. These are meant to be classic 501's. Not some designer slim fit jeans. The fit on these is just uncomfortable and Levi's are obviously trying to emulate some higher end jeans that are tighter fitting and but they just fail miserably and pissing off their long time customers.\n",

Those 501's fit me comfortably and they lasted 11 years. 11 years total wearing in regular rotation.\n",

Though it was a little roomy - I'm happy to report - it looked the part. Unfortunately it did not \"feel\" the part. Compared to my older jeans it was very, very light. After a few weeks one seam broke, actually not the seam, but the fabric next to the seam. After having this was fixed the fabric broke next to one of the back pockets, then next to the fly buttons and yesterday, whilst kneeling down to take a photograph, the entire back ripped. After reading the other reviews pertaining to these jeans it would seem many were right in stating the jeans fabric used by Levis nowadays is of an inferior quality. So, after nearly 20 years of buying 501's I can safely say I'll never buy one again.\n",

I ordered a pair of 501s only to find what I had anticipated: build quality was crap (the stitching looks like third graders did it with a knitting needle (actually, that's probably not far from the truth)), material was thin and reminded me of the cheapos that typically end up on clearance racks), the fit after one wash was absurd.

I would much rather have paid a higher price and have them left things the way they were, but I guess they would not get the volume of sales to support such a concept.

The receipt mentioned Levi's 501s, but didn't specifically say shrink-to-fit.  I wasn't sure if it should and I trusted the receipt would actually reflect what the web page advertised.  The jeans arrived in a couple days, but were not shrink-to-fit.  The return process was relatively easy and painless, which is why I will continue to buy non-clothes items from Amazon.

      "Well, I have really tried to give Levi 501 a fair shake due to my loyalty to the company. They have always been my favorite jeans that fit the best and hold up over time. Unfortunately, the consistency of quality is nothing compared to what it used to be. I have ordered 3 pair over a period of time (6months), all 501. Different colors. Same size. Each pair is different. Different material, different sizing, different construction. The denim on all three are totally different. One pair is so thin you can almost see through them. Another pair has thick denim as stiff as a board, yet another pair is exactly as it should be. The leg openings are different on each pair as much as an inch smaller to an inch bigger. The stitching and workmanship is mediocre at best. I'm very disappointed. The 501 is the original Levi Jean, why would you stray from anything that has worked so well for so long. These jeans do not qualify for the price point they are currently being offered at. Maybe half, if I was feeling generous. So, after close to 20 years of being a loyal, die hard Levi 501 consumer, NO MORE!!! I WILL NOT PAY QUALITY PRICE FOR SUB PAR PRODUCT. SHAME ON YOU LEVI!!! I will be donating to Good Will because I refuse to wear and advertise or promote your product. If I were Amazon I would refuse to sell this product as advertised. Merry Christmas to All!!!!\n",

Why can't their cloth cutting machines get it right? The whole process should be done by machines with no errors in size. Don't they even check the jeans before they send them out. I have a tip for anyone wanting to get rich. Make jeans called \"Perfect Fit\", and make sure they are always the same cut and fit.. You'll put Levis out of business.\n",

The only thing consistent about the 501's (and the 514's) is that the inconsistency in both fit, size, and especially quality is astounding. I called Levi's myself, and they are aware of the inconsistentency in their products. They have opened up new factories so quickly, that the problem went unnoticed for almost 2 years. They were very honest with me, and are working diligently to alleviate the problem. Eighteen pair of mine are perfect in every way. All are consistent in every way. The last two pair I purchased were off to each other in every way. The waist and inseam are off as much as 3/4 of an inch. When I put my wallet in the back pocket on one new pair, The back pocket ripped @ the corner. That when I called them, and they admitted that the weight of the denim was one of the problems.

      "I bought two pairs of the 501 Levi's for $30 each about 7 years ago. These pairs lasted for about 6 years with regular use and key to this story, they both wore out in the thighs (not the crotch) - where I expect bluejeans to wear out. I loved them. A year ago it was finally time to replace my old jeans. I bought another two pairs of the 501 Levi's, which had gone up $20 per pair, but no problem: I loved the other pairs so much that I was willing to spend $50 on each new pair of jeans.\n",

      "So I read up on the Levi lifetime warranty for defects in material and workmanship. Surely this batch of Levi's were defective. I took both pairs to a Levi Outlet Store. The sales clerk inspected the pants. He thought for a little while. And he reached a judgement: the holes were from normal use. I explained that I was living my life in the same way as before, but he already has his conclusion. After I expressed my disappointment in the quality of these pants and that Levi was not going to honor their warranty, the sales associate, as a last resort to get me out of his store, offered me a discount on a new pair. I decided that no, in fact I would not pay any more money for jeans that have a lifespan of months. Also, I will not buy any more jeans from Levi because I feel that they have been insincere in their warranty and to their customers, and they are making second-rate jeans.\n",

Should my disappointment be shared by Levi's?  These certainly aren't the Dark Blue Jeans I recall, jeans that slowly fade and effectively mold to the shape fo the wearer..  No, these were somehow pre-faded. Yuck,  What the Heck, man?  And the fit?

Mexico always makes the pants that fit perfectly for whatever size needed. I gained weight and needed 35\" waisted pants, something impossible to find in stores, so I ended up buying them from The Levi's Store online - and never had a problem with the sizing. I've now lost some weight and need 33\" waisted pants. Just bought 2 pair from Amazon (they were about the same cost but 2 day free shipping on Amazon). The other pair was 33\"x32\" 501s called \"Bleached\" - tried them on - and PERFECT. Checked the tag and yup - made in Mexico. (On a side note, Amazon's website shows that ALL their 501s are made in Mexico which is a total lie). When I tried this pair on, they were TIGHT! Aside from barely able to getting them up, the button-up fly eyes weren't the normal size - I could barely get the button through the buttonhole on every single button. Got them all buttoned up and - ack - I could barely breath! Had just as much problem getting the button fly OPEN as I did closing it - then it took an extra hand to peel the pant leg off. I checked the tag and - made in Mexica? HAHAHA, no, no, no. They were made in Egypt! Any pants I've receive made in Egypt, Burma, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia - anywhere but Mexico - they are too small! These are going back - but at least the other pair fit (love the color of the Bleached!) and guess I'm back to ordering through Levi's or in an actual store.\n",

They had all these different colors in the cheapest feeling materials imaginable. The black ones felt and looked like they were dipped in wax.

I wouldn't even try them on and left the store. I went to Kohl's and tried on a pair of Lee's. What a difference! They are made of real denim, fit well and were cheaper.

ALL genuine Levis have the red tag, and they ALWAYS have the word \"LEVIS\" printed on them. The jeans were also weirdly wrinkled along the front of the crotch and top of thighs, as though the wrinkles were deliberately induced, but the texture was sort of stiff and crackly.

The styling on Levi's are bizarre because I have a pair of slim fit Levi's that are a smaller size than these (32x32) and they fit more loose than the 501's. I've owned higher end jeans by Armani Exchange, some slim fit by the Swedish company Cheap Monday. And the fit on these are tighter on my thighs than either of those. These are meant to be classic 501's. Not some designer slim fit jeans. The fit on these is just uncomfortable and Levi's are obviously trying to emulate some higher end jeans that are tighter fitting and but they just fail miserably and pissing off their long time customers.\n",

Those 501's fit me comfortably and they lasted 11 years. 11 years total wearing in regular rotation.\n",

Though it was a little roomy - I'm happy to report - it looked the part. Unfortunately it did not \"feel\" the part. Compared to my older jeans it was very, very light. After a few weeks one seam broke, actually not the seam, but the fabric next to the seam. After having this was fixed the fabric broke next to one of the back pockets, then next to the fly buttons and yesterday, whilst kneeling down to take a photograph, the entire back ripped. After reading the other reviews pertaining to these jeans it would seem many were right in stating the jeans fabric used by Levis nowadays is of an inferior quality.

But there was: a thin, shiny, denim-like fabric unlike any other Levi's product I had ever bought. I returned it immediately.\n",

      "I was very unhappy with this purchase; I will no longer purchase clothes from Amazon.  I was looking for a pair of shrink to fit jeans in my hard-to-find size.  The Amazon web page that came up advertised Levi's 501 shrink-to-fit jeans in the size, and I proceeded to select a pair.  The receipt mentioned Levi's 501s, but didn't specifically say shrink-to-fit.  I wasn't sure if it should and I trusted the receipt would actually reflect what the web page advertised.  The jeans arrived in a couple days, but were not shrink-to-fit.  The return process was relatively easy and painless, which is why I will continue to buy non-clothes items from Amazon.  However, the online resolution screen haughtily claimed that since the purchasing error was my fault, Amazon would not pay for the shipping.  There are too many unknowns in fit when purchasing clothes from potentially erroneous web sites for me to repeat this exercise.\n",

      "Well, I have really tried to give Levi 501 a fair shake due to my loyalty to the company. They have always been my favorite jeans that fit the best and hold up over time. Unfortunately, the consistency of quality is nothing compared to what it used to be. I have ordered 3 pair over a period of time (6months), all 501. Different colors. Same size. Each pair is different. Different material, different sizing, different construction. The denim on all three are totally different. One pair is so thin you can almost see through them. Another pair has thick denim as stiff as a board, yet another pair is exactly as it should be. The leg openings are different on each pair as much as an inch smaller to an inch bigger. The stitching and workmanship is mediocre at best. I'm very disappointed. The 501 is the original Levi Jean, why would you stray from anything that has worked so well for so long. These jeans do not qualify for the price point they are currently being offered at. Maybe half, if I was feeling generous. So, after close to 20 years of being a loyal, die hard Levi 501 consumer, NO MORE!!! I WILL NOT PAY QUALITY PRICE FOR SUB PAR PRODUCT. SHAME ON YOU LEVI!!! I will be donating to Good Will because I refuse to wear and advertise or promote your product. If I were Amazon I would refuse to sell this product as advertised. Merry Christmas to All!!!!\n",

No wonder they were under my feet when I put them on.  So, I have joined others who have criticized the quality of the fit.

I went to Macy's flagship store in Herald Square, NY thinking they would have the real McCoy's. Boy, was I disappointed. They had all these different colors in the cheapest feeling materials imaginable. The black ones felt and looked like they were dipped in wax. I wouldn't even consider all the pretty reds and greens and blues. Levi's were always made for men. Now it seems they are mad for 'funny' men. Even the blue jean material felt thin and cheap. I wouldn't even try them on and left the store. I went to Kohl's and tried on a pair of Lee's. What a difference! They are made of real denim, fit well and were cheaper. They don't have all the cuts and 'pretty' colors that Levi's do but if I'm buying jeans I don't want funny colors and weird fits. NO MORE LEVI'S!\n",

The first washing they went from Black to a streaked washed denim look, I was ok with that, but should have suspected something wasn't quite right.  After only 3 washes and on the 4th wearing the denim let go in the groin when I was sitting down.  Something that hasn't happened in other pants I've owned util I've worn them for 4-5 years of hard use.  I was not pleased at all and won't be buying the black 501's again anytime soon.

Now I have a desk job, and they wear out in less than a year.  The denim of two pairs has worn thin around the pockets and thighs, while the pocket liners have remained in tact.  That seems to say something about the relative quality of the materials.  I thought denim was supposed to be tough?  And unlike some of the people commenting about the risks of buying mail order, I'm talking about jeans I bought from a shop.

Each pair is different. Different material, different sizing, different construction. The denim on all three are totally different. One pair is so thin you can almost see through them. Another pair has thick denim as stiff as a board, yet another pair is exactly as it should be. The leg openings are different on each pair as much as an inch smaller to an inch bigger. The stitching and workmanship is mediocre at best. I'm very disappointed. The 501 is the original Levi Jean, why would you stray from anything that has worked so well for so long. These jeans do not qualify for the price point they are currently being offered at. Maybe half, if I was feeling generous.

They had all these different colors in the cheapest feeling materials imaginable. The black ones felt and looked like they were dipped in wax. I wouldn't even consider all the pretty reds and greens and blues. Levi's were always made for men. Now it seems they are mad for 'funny' men. Even the blue jean material felt thin and cheap. I wouldn't even try them on and left the store. I went to Kohl's and tried on a pair of Lee's. What a difference! They are made of real denim, fit well and were cheaper. They don't have all the cuts and 'pretty' colors that Levi's do but if I'm buying jeans I don't want funny colors and weird fits. NO MORE LEVI'S!\n",

The first washing they went from Black to a streaked washed denim look, I was ok with that, but should have suspected something wasn't quite right.  After only 3 washes and on the 4th wearing the denim let go in the groin when I was sitting down.  Something that hasn't happened in other pants I've owned util I've worn them for 4-5 years of hard use.  I was not pleased at all and won't be buying the black 501's again anytime soon.  I have other regular Levi's that seem to hold up just fine, but reading some of the reviews apparently I'm not the only guy who felt a breeze where they weren't expecting it, in a very short time after wearing these jeans...\n",

Now I have a desk job, and they wear out in less than a year.  The denim of two pairs has worn thin around the pockets and thighs, while the pocket liners have remained in tact.  That seems to say something about the relative quality of the materials.  I thought denim was supposed to be tough?  And unlike some of the people commenting about the risks of buying mail order, I'm talking about jeans I bought from a shop.

All my other pairs fit fine so it is not the post Thanksgiving swelling. I will never buy Levis online again. If you must buy these levis get them at least 2-3 sizes larger in the waist and 2 sizes longer than you normally wear.

I have no idea what was in the head of whoever designed and thought a guy wants a button fly with the classic metal buttons and the slightly too small holes. I'm left to wonder, has there been a lot of complaints from men about the metal zipper? Do a lot of guys enjoy wrestling with the five classic metal buttons and the reinforced holes that are too small? Lesson learned. This was first and last time I buy Jeans online without taking the extra time to investigate the fly opening.

Then they offered the preshrunk version which was more user friendly. 501's used to last many years ... I always had several pair and they all fit the same. The current version is junk! Don't waste your money! They don't fit properly anymore and they are poorly made! The last two pair I bought were too big in the waste and butt and too tight in the thigh area. Actually, that was only for one pair, the other pair had distinctly different issues. I wish I could say I've slimmed down in the waste and bulked up my thighs but I'd be lying if I did! Like everyone else's reviews, the belt loops mysteriously unattach themselves and the rear pocket corners rip open. I can only assume that the 10 year old working in the sweatshop in Jakarta couldn't afford breakfast when he began his 12 hour day at the sewing machine!

Unfortunately, the consistency of quality is nothing compared to what it used to be. I have ordered 3 pair over a period of time (6months), all 501. Different colors. Same size. Each pair is different. Different material, different sizing, different construction. The denim on all three are totally different. One pair is so thin you can almost see through them. Another pair has thick denim as stiff as a board, yet another pair is exactly as it should be. The leg openings are different on each pair as much as an inch smaller to an inch bigger. The stitching and workmanship is mediocre at best. I'm very disappointed. The 501 is the original Levi Jean, why would you stray from anything that has worked so well for so long. These jeans do not qualify for the price point they are currently being offered at. Maybe half, if I was feeling generous. So, after close to 20 years of being a loyal, die hard Levi 501 consumer, NO MORE!!! I WILL NOT PAY QUALITY PRICE FOR SUB PAR PRODUCT. SHAME ON YOU LEVI!!!

Two more pairs of 501s from Macy's, same thing. Levi's really has to step their game up, or they are going to lose the American market. The sad thing is that the same Chinese and Egyptian-made 501s are going for the equivalent of about US$100 in department stores in Taiwan.

I can't even think of how many pairs of jeans I have bought during that time.  However, in the past couple years I have become very disappointed with them.  I use to be able to walk into the store, grab my size off the shelf and pay for them.  I would have sales people ask if I wanted to try them on and I would say \"no thanks, I know they fit\".  Recently though, the sizes have been all over the place.  I'm also very disappointed in the quality.  I can't get a pair to last more than 6 months without wearing out the knees or the crotch.  Definitely cheaper materials being used and I can just tell by the feel that they are much thinner than they use to be.  I needed a new pair of jeans a couple weeks ago (since my Levi's gave out after only a couple months) and decided to try a different brand.  After looking at several of them I decided to give Wranglers a try.  Mainly because they are made out of a thicker denim plus they only cost a third of what my Levi's did.  I've worn them for about a month pretty much on a daily basis and they look as good as when I bought them.  If I can get them to last twice as long for a third of the cost I'm going to save myself a lot of money.  While I miss the button fly I think I can easily get use to these jeans.

The Amazon web page that came up advertised Levi's 501 shrink-to-fit jeans in the size, and I proceeded to select a pair.  The receipt mentioned Levi's 501s, but didn't specifically say shrink-to-fit.  I wasn't sure if it should and I trusted the receipt would actually reflect what the web page advertised.  The jeans arrived in a couple days, but were not shrink-to-fit.  The return process was relatively easy and painless, which is why I will continue to buy non-clothes items from Amazon.  However, the online resolution screen haughtily claimed that since the purchasing error was my fault, Amazon would not pay for the shipping.

All my other pairs fit fine so it is not the post Thanksgiving swelling. I will never buy Levis online again. If you must buy these levis get them at least 2-3 sizes larger in the waist and 2 sizes longer than you normally wear.

I have no idea what was in the head of whoever designed and thought a guy wants a button fly with the classic metal buttons and the slightly too small holes. I'm left to wonder, has there been a lot of complaints from men about the metal zipper? Do a lot of guys enjoy wrestling with the five classic metal buttons and the reinforced holes that are too small? Lesson learned. This was first and last time I buy Jeans online without taking the extra time to investigate the fly opening.

Then they offered the preshrunk version which was more user friendly. 501's used to last many years ... I always had several pair and they all fit the same. The current version is junk! Don't waste your money! They don't fit properly anymore and they are poorly made! The last two pair I bought were too big in the waste and butt and too tight in the thigh area. Actually, that was only for one pair, the other pair had distinctly different issues. I wish I could say I've slimmed down in the waste and bulked up my thighs but I'd be lying if I did! Like everyone else's reviews, the belt loops mysteriously unattach themselves and the rear pocket corners rip open. I can only assume that the 10 year old working in the sweatshop in Jakarta couldn't afford breakfast when he began his 12 hour day at the sewing machine!

Unfortunately, the consistency of quality is nothing compared to what it used to be. I have ordered 3 pair over a period of time (6months), all 501. Different colors. Same size. Each pair is different. Different material, different sizing, different construction. The denim on all three are totally different. One pair is so thin you can almost see through them. Another pair has thick denim as stiff as a board, yet another pair is exactly as it should be. The leg openings are different on each pair as much as an inch smaller to an inch bigger. The stitching and workmanship is mediocre at best. I'm very disappointed. The 501 is the original Levi Jean, why would you stray from anything that has worked so well for so long. These jeans do not qualify for the price point they are currently being offered at. Maybe half, if I was feeling generous. So, after close to 20 years of being a loyal, die hard Levi 501 consumer, NO MORE!!! I WILL NOT PAY QUALITY PRICE FOR SUB PAR PRODUCT. SHAME ON YOU LEVI!!!

I can't even think of how many pairs of jeans I have bought during that time.  However, in the past couple years I have become very disappointed with them.  I use to be able to walk into the store, grab my size off the shelf and pay for them.  I would have sales people ask if I wanted to try them on and I would say \"no thanks, I know they fit\".  Recently though, the sizes have been all over the place.  I'm also very disappointed in the quality.  I can't get a pair to last more than 6 months without wearing out the knees or the crotch.  Definitely cheaper materials being used and I can just tell by the feel that they are much thinner than they use to be.  I needed a new pair of jeans a couple weeks ago (since my Levi's gave out after only a couple months) and decided to try a different brand.  After looking at several of them I decided to give Wranglers a try.  Mainly because they are made out of a thicker denim plus they only cost a third of what my Levi's did.  I've worn them for about a month pretty much on a daily basis and they look as good as when I bought them.  If I can get them to last twice as long for a third of the cost I'm going to save myself a lot of money.  While I miss the button fly I think I can easily get use to these jeans.

Yes, the last four pair I have purchased from Amazon and they last about six-to-eight months. The inseam has torn on two pair, making them unwearable. And this is only from casual use!!! I remember the days when I used to wear Levi's as a work pant, and they would last through years of heavy abuse. Now, with this thinner material, you could easily destroy a brand new pair by just getting into a car.\n",

The pair I bought February 15th--one month and eight days ago--have already split from the bottom all the way to the zipper. I always thought I bought denim because it was tougher than normal cloth.

Despite the fact that the label on this pair of pants said \"33x32\", they were so small that I couldn't even try them on past my knees. Clearly there are some quality control issues with this store.

The jeans arrived in a couple days, but were not shrink-to-fit.  The return process was relatively easy and painless, which is why I will continue to buy non-clothes items from Amazon.

This is the third pair of Levi's I've purchased new in the last year and a half. The first two pairs have worn out beyond wearable use in less than a year and have ended up in the trash bin. I have no assurance that these will last longer than that either.\n",

The styling on Levi's are bizarre because I have a pair of slim fit Levi's that are a smaller size than these (32x32) and they fit more loose than the 501's. I've owned higher end jeans by Armani Exchange, some slim fit by the Swedish company Cheap Monday. And the fit on these are tighter on my thighs than either of those. These are meant to be classic 501's. Not some designer slim fit jeans. The fit on these is just uncomfortable and Levi's are obviously trying to emulate some higher end jeans that are tighter fitting and but they just fail miserably and pissing off their long time customers.\n",

Those 501's fit me comfortably and they lasted 11 years. 11 years total wearing in regular rotation.\n",

Though it was a little roomy - I'm happy to report - it looked the part. Unfortunately it did not \"feel\" the part. Compared to my older jeans it was very, very light. After a few weeks one seam broke, actually not the seam, but the fabric next to the seam. After having this was fixed the fabric broke next to one of the back pockets, then next to the fly buttons and yesterday, whilst kneeling down to take a photograph, the entire back ripped. After reading the other reviews pertaining to these jeans it would seem many were right in stating the jeans fabric used by Levis nowadays is of an inferior quality. So, after nearly 20 years of buying 501's I can safely say I'll never buy one again.\n",

Starting almost a year ago it is an absolute fact that these jeans no longer hold up for years the way they used to.  In the past (at least up until 2 or 3 years ago) my husband would have about 4 pairs of jeans, so he might be washing them farily frequently.  It was not unusual for a pair to last at least a couple of years.  But since a year and a half ago or so, his jeans have been wearing through in about 4 to 6 months.  He has many more pairs, so they do not get washed as often and are not subject to stress from the washer and dryer.  The seams split at the crotch and down the legs and the seat wears.  He does not give them rough wear.  He is a college professor who is on his feet a lot, but not in a physically stressful job.  Levi's just are not as good as they used to be and any one who says differently hasn't been buying them or wearing them as much as we have.\n",

I thought Levi's has a very reputable brand and make but I feel like i bought something from a garage sale.. (i mean i can probably find a better pants in my neighbor's garage sale) DO NOT buy.  No where close to what the photos indicate. Please amazon.. you know better. You got to require these companies to provide real photos of the actual product.  THis is the first time i felt scammed perhaps that's over statement. maybe trick. is a good word.  I don't know how it got some many 1000 4 stars.  I'm not a hater or anything but this is one bad buy.  I will never wear this pants it doesn't look good.  I don't want to ship it back for a refund. This pant is perfect for a rag..\n",

This is the third pair of Levi's I've purchased new in the last year and a half. The first two pairs have worn out beyond wearable use in less than a year and have ended up in the trash bin. I have no assurance that these will last longer than that either.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fit and style of these are strange. They fit me around the waist but around the thighs and crotch they are much too small around my thighs. The styling on Levi's are bizarre because I have a pair of slim fit Levi's that are a smaller size than these (32x32) and they fit more loose than the 501's. I've owned higher end jeans by Armani Exchange, some slim fit by the Swedish company Cheap Monday. And the fit on these are tighter on my thighs than either of those. These are meant to be classic 501's. Not some designer slim fit jeans. The fit on these is just uncomfortable and Levi's are obviously trying to emulate some higher end jeans that are tighter fitting and but they just fail miserably and pissing off their long time customers.\n",

      "As a comparison of how terrible the quality of Levi's have become over the last few years, I had a pair of Levi's 501 that I purchased at age 16. They were beater jeans, worn in regular rotation until I lost them during a move a couple of years ago. Those 501's fit me comfortably and they lasted 11 years. 11 years total wearing in regular rotation.\n",

I washed them on the delicate cycle with some of my other sensitive clothing, and they came out looking terrible. They are irreparably wrinkled and there is marbling all over. No I didn't use any sort of bleach....Not even ironing gets the wrinkles out. Unfortunately I can't sent them back. Will never by these again.\n",

Though it was a little roomy - I'm happy to report - it looked the part. Unfortunately it did not \"feel\" the part. Compared to my older jeans it was very, very light. After a few weeks one seam broke, actually not the seam, but the fabric next to the seam. After having this was fixed the fabric broke next to one of the back pockets, then next to the fly buttons and yesterday, whilst kneeling down to take a photograph, the entire back ripped. After reading the other reviews pertaining to these jeans it would seem many were right in stating the jeans fabric used by Levis nowadays is of an inferior quality. So, after nearly 20 years of buying 501's I can safely say I'll never buy one again.\n",

      "I have been buying the sized 501's (not the Shrink-to=Fits) for my husband for nearly 15 years.  Starting almost a year ago it is an absolute fact that these jeans no longer hold up for years the way they used to.  In the past (at least up until 2 or 3 years ago) my husband would have about 4 pairs of jeans, so he might be washing them farily frequently.  It was not unusual for a pair to last at least a couple of years.  But since a year and a half ago or so, his jeans have been wearing through in about 4 to 6 months.  He has many more pairs, so they do not get washed as often and are not subject to stress from the washer and dryer.  The seams split at the crotch and down the legs and the seat wears.  He does not give them rough wear.  He is a college professor who is on his feet a lot, but not in a physically stressful job.  Levi's just are not as good as they used to be and any one who says differently hasn't been buying them or wearing them as much as we have.\n",

These \"Iconic Rigid\" jeans are made of some sleazy, much lighter material that takes on a carefully contrived set of wrinkles to make them look like they'd been worn to bed soaking wet and dried out overnight.
